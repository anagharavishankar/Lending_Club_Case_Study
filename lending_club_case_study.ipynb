Like other lenders, issuing loans to risky applicants is the primary cause of financial loss, termed credit loss, where 'charged-off' borrowers who default cause the most significant loss to lenders. This credit loss results from borrowers refusing to pay or disappearing with owed money, marking them as defaulters.\n"
